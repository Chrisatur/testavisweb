She has written short stories, novels, poetry, and a historical novel in several genres. Her self-help book, Who Gets Your Money, was published in the early 1990s. Although it is out of print and outdated, it is being revised and updated for future publication. Avis has written articles which were published in the national newsletter for Silva Mind Systems and an article published in an international issue of Oriental Express. Her poetry won honorable mention in a nationwide contest several years ago. Avis is presently retired and plans to devote more of her time to her first love\u2026creation of stories that inspire and entertain.<\/p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ask Avis about her life and she will say, \u201cIt has been filled with a lot of happiness, some sorrow, fantastic opportunities, many interesting events and blessings, and I expect it to continue for many more years.\u201d Family is one of her passions. She was married at 17 but raised four children as a single mother, two of whom were her biological sons. She does not believe that family is defined by DNA, color, culture or gender. Another lifelong passion is creative writing which began as a teenager. Many articles she wrote appeared in specialty magazines and international newsletters. Her book on shams and scams published in 1990 is no longer available and is, of course, out of date but is being revised. There is a novel and many more creations on her computer waiting to be shared.<\/p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Avis claims she is living life backward. During her adulthood, she had many responsible and executive jobs in the business world without a college degree. Then in 2015, at age 78, she attended Ashford University and graduated in 2019 with a 3.9 GPA and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Gerontology. Presently she is attending Saybrook University for a master\u2019s degree in Mind Body Medicine. As a firm believer in natural and holistic medicine, she rarely takes prescription medication. Her general health is a testimonial to that dedication. She continues to enjoy her family that has expanded to grandchildren and a great grandson, and her future plans include publishing more books and stories,,\u2026 and pursuing her PhD.
